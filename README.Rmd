hercdectables is a data package that contains glossaries for US Census groups.

A glossary is a mapping from variable names to a collection of explicit values
that the variables encode.
For example, a variable in the Census database might report a count of the
number of people from one demographic group living in one type of housing and
primarily speaking one language.
The glossary for that group would include columns of demographic group, housing
type, and primary language.
These glossaries explain the Census API's Decennial group tables.

## Installation
